# data-collection-challenge

__Background__

Working on this challenge gave me the opportunity to strengthen core skills that I've been developing: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating my insights.

__What I Created__

This new assigment consists of two technical products. I completed the following deliverables:

__Deliverable 1:__ Scraped titles and previewed text from [Mars News Articles](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html).

__Deliverable 2:__ Scraped and analyzed Mars weather data from an [existing table](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html).
